				 <div class="answer">
					 <p>
						 There are a lot different factors that have to be considered in order to develop an effective foreign policy statement for U.S. aid to Uganda. First of all, the people in Uganda should be more aware of this issue, and it also applies to the US’ side because in order to help the country, the US should know how big of a problem it is there (meaning that the US needs true statistics about how serious the problem is.) This is the point where more issues come into play, such as education of the doctors, trust from the patients and of course the doctor's ability to recognize and treat the disease. Also, the issue that Uganda is facing right now is the shortage of specialists and also there is this fear from the patients to go to the real doctors, they try to solve problems with herbs and folk medicine. Most importantly, we need to know the numbers of people with the disease and their status. Status here means, the stage they are in, the spread of the disease and patients’ willingness to undergo treatment, how it was stated in the article, when Ms. Namata was talked out of the surgery, at first by her friends and family. If the patient gets lucky and gets diagnosed on stage one, then we need to know if she is ready to undergo the mastectomy because as of right now it is the only option there. The technology in sub-Saharan Africa is not as advanced as in the developed western countries.

						In more developed countries such as the US, mammograms are offered and suggested every year or two to all healthy females over the age of 40 or 50. However, in less developed countries this service is not always available because of a few reasons, lack of specialists, lack of hospitals and of course the locations of the institutions where people can come for the check. That’s where another issue comes up, the issue with mobility and social-economical status of the country as a whole. The other difference would be the advancement of the technology. In the western world we have more ultrasound machines and specialists than in sub-Saharan Africa, meaning that it is harder to catch the disease when it just has started. Moreover, the doctors that know how to treat cancer, oncologists, are very busy there, they have around 35/40 patients a day. They say that they are tortured by their own success, the problem is that there are not enough doctors to treat all the patients.

				 <p>To what extent is the medical system in Uganda corrupted and how can the US support Uganda’s hospitals in order to help it? </p>
			 </div>
			 <div class="answer">
				 <p>
					 The medical system in Uganda is very corrupted in a lot of ways. First of all, the doctors there can be easily bribed to cut the lines. "The hospital has two tiers: free, public wards for the poor, and a private one for those who can pay. Paying patients are generally treated more quickly" (Grady). Meaning that there are people that are willing and able to pay more for their treatment or for a better attitude from the doctors to get "special treatment." In the private sector, to use mammograms, private hospitals charge a lot of money that usual Uganda citizens cannot spend that much money on their health.
				 </p>
				<p>
					The US can help Uganda in many different ways; however, a direct tranche of money would be the wrong decision. The reason for that is that Uganda's medical workers are corrupted and that this money would not be used wisely. The best practice, in this case, would be to help the government to build more hospitals, buy modern equipment and help them to train people in the medical field to use that modern equipment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, the US must send doctors for educational purposes, maybe even create an "exchange" program where doctors from Uganda would come to the US to learn from the western experts. Moreover, there is a lack of free drugs in the hospitals, and the prices for them in the pharmacies are pretty high. The socio-economic situation in Uganda is not flourishing, meaning that there are people that are facing a lot of problems such as hunger, sanitary issues, and others. This is another factor that helps corruption to flourish, making it harder for people to get treatment on time.

				<p>
					The distribution of hospitals in Uganda vary in how far they are from each other, and so this affects people's decisions to go to the hospital or not. As seen in "Figure 1," of Aetna's report, the regional referral hospitals/ centers even demonstrate a disproportionate distribution in hospitals, only touching certain areas of the country. Therefore, also reaching a hospital is severe enough, let alone a hospital with the necessary resources to detect breast cancer or with the correct tools for treatment. In the country, there are minimal amounts of hospitals with essential resources such as mammogram machines (according to Bioline International, "only four mammogram machines exist for a population of 6-7 million eligible women.") Some of these machines are also privately owned and require specific fees of which the cost is far too high for Ugandan women on average. With this being said, the cost, time, and effort to travel to a hospital, on top of having to pay an unreasonable fee for one of these tests turn women away from seeking treatment or being able to detect breast cancer in early stages. Breast ultrasound machines are less expensive than these mammogram machines but again are limited to individual facilities in specific areas of the country that are often far for many. There are around 30 radiologists in Uganda and at least 60 sonographers, leaving the population of women eligible for mammograms, sonograms, ultrasounds, etc. quite vulnerable and out of reach. Since accessibility to hospitals is difficult for many across the country and accessibility to facilities with the necessary programs and resources for breast health is even more challenging to reach, women must explore other options for treatment and detection. Among these include the use of "USScan" and Breast Self Examination. However, these do not have a lot of evidence to support their accuracy, obviously compared to an ultrasound or mammogram. In addition to this, some "unexplored options in resource-limited settings are task shifting by the involvement of non-physician care in Breast HealthCare. With this in mind, these adaptations to a lacking system significantly affect the treatment and detection of breast cancer. As previously mentioned, with the little hospitals the country has, and with the limited resources they offer, women have to adapt to new ways to detect and treat, which usually aren't as effective as those methods in health care systems.
